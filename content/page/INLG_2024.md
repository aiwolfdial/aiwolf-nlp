## 　概要 

​The AIWolfDia-l2024-INLG workshop, officially titled "The 2nd Workshop of AI Werewolf and Dialog System (AIWolfDial2024) at INLG 2024," was scheduled to take place on September 23 or 24, 2024, in Tokyo, Japan, as part of the INLG 2024 conference. ​

---

Workshop Overview:

The workshop focused on the integration of dialog systems, natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), and game AI, particularly within the context of the Werewolf game. This social deduction game requires players to engage in debate, inference, persuasion, and deception, making it an ideal testbed for advancing AI capabilities in coherent dialogue, long-context understanding, common ground establishment, and logical reasoning.

---

Shared Task:

As part of the workshop, we hosted an international open contest for AI agents playing the Werewolf game. Participants were challenged to develop autonomous players capable of engaging in not only strategic gameplay, but also logical, persuasive, and deceptive conversations with other AI. The contest served as a benchmark for exploring the limits of current LLMs and identifying key challenges and future directions in NLP.
