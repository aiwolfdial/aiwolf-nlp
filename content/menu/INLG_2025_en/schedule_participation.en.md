## Preliminary and Main Rounds

- In the preliminary round, participants submit logs of self-play matches (agents from the same team playing against each other).
- The main round will use match logs from mutual games between agents of different teams. Depending on the number of teams, main round participants may be selected based on preliminary results.
- The main round is English-track only.
- From this edition, both 5-player (2 Villagers + 1 Werewolf + 1 Seer + 1 Madman) and 13-player (6 Villagers + 3 Werewolves + 1 Seer + 1 Madman + 1 Medium + 1 Bodyguard) village settings will be available. You may participate in one or both tracks.

## How to Participate & Evaluation Criteria

- Participation is open to teams of one or more people. There are no specific eligibility requirements â€” anyone is welcome to join. After the contest, each team will be asked to submit a document describing their system in detail.
- Each team must fill out the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmxdM1Op5jM5dIi3ViElr6O3_JwQ5GnbWu7_FJSX7lxeOqBg/viewform?usp=dialog). Required information includes: team name, contact email for the representative, names and affiliations of all members, whether to make the names/affiliations public (if not, only the team name will be used), and the email address used for Slack registration.
- There is no registration fee.
- Participants are encouraged to attend INLG 2025 either on-site or online.
<!-- - Top-ranked teams may receive cash prizes and gifts sponsored by Spiral.AI Inc., a developer of conversational LLMs. -->
<!-- - Notes on paper submission to be added. -->
- Submitted documents and game logs may be published or used for research purposes.
- Judges will evaluate based on both subjective impression and win rate from the main round. Planned subjective evaluation criteria include:
- A: Are the utterances natural?
- B: Is the conversation context-aware and natural?
- C: Are the utterances consistent and free of contradictions?
- D: Do game actions (voting, attacks, divination, etc.) align with the dialogue content?
- E: Are the utterances expressive, consistent with the given profiles, and do they convey unique character traits per agent?
- F: Is there evidence of team play? (Applicable to the 13-player village only)
