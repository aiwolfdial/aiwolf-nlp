## Call for Peer-Reviewed Paper Submissions

The AIWolfDial2025 workshop is now accepting submissions of peer-reviewed papers.
Topics are not limited to AI Werewolf but include dialog generation using LLMs and autonomous gameplay in general.
Evaluation results from the AI Werewolf International Competition will be announced before the paper submission deadline, allowing participants to base their papers on those results.
Submitting a paper is not mandatory for participating in the competition, but it is highly encouraged.
The workshop will be held in a hybrid format: both on-site and online presentations are planned.
